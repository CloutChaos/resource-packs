Dark Mode Teal is a pack dedicated to being easy on the eyes, with dark mode supremacy as the focal point of its conception. Fixing a lot of the Jagex teams art imperfections/inconsistencies, DMT strives to be the cleanest *alternative* to the default OSRS experience.

Pack has Custom Options for: Login Screen, Spells/Prayers, and Overlay Colour. Tons of small changes here and there to give personality.

Want to provide feedback? @Skyzx on the Resource Pack discord with a suggestion!
